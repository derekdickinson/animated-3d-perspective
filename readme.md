# Borland DOS graphics example code

This is an old school project. Just posted it on the off chance that 
someone might want to use it as an example.

Demonstrates the perspective equations and has a primitive animation
variation.

It is a simple example of the perspective and motion calculations. These
are surprisingly simple. In addition, it uses the two bitplanes to demonstrate
the difference in smoothness that arises when trying to update on a single
plane.
